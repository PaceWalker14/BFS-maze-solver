# BFS-maze-solver

This is a simple C++ program that finds the shortest path through a maze using Breadth-First Search (BFS). I wrote this to practice pathfinding logic and grid-based algorithms.

## Maze Representation

The maze is represented as a grid of characters:
```
'x' = wall (you can't move here)
'S' = start point
'G' = goal point
' ' (space) = open path

The program reads in the maze of any size and figures out the shortest path from S to G using a BFS tree.

Once the path is found, it backtracks from the goal to the start and marks the path using '*' on the maze.
```

## How it works:
```
Finds the shortest path (if it exists).
If no path exists, prints "No Path".
Marks the path visually using '*'.
Pretty clean and readable logic.
```
## Each move keeps track of:
```
How far it has gone (distance array)
Where it came from (parent array)
```

## Example input with a 5x5 matrix:
```
5 5
xxxxx
xS x
x xx
x Gx
xxxxx
```
## Example of output with a 5x5 matrix:
```
xxxxx
xS x
x*x x
x**Gx
xxxxx
```
## How to run with bash:

```bash
g++ -o maze_solver maze_solver.cpp
./maze_solver
